Box2D Examples by Seth Ladd, made modular with requirejs by Jarrod Overson
==========================================================================

This was done entirely as an experiment to help me learn Box2D by way of rewriting/porting
Seth Ladd's examples starting here:

http://blog.sethladd.com/2011/08/box2d-orientation-for-javascript.html

Only the examples that were significant pieces of changed code were ported.

This is still a work in progress, getting it on github is for my own organization.

Relevant licenses should still be intact from the original source:

Anything new that doesn't fall under derivative is BSD licensed.
